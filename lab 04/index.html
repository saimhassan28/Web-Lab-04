   <h3 >T1: Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
i  Prompts the user for first number.
ii Stores that first number
iii Prompts the user for the second number
Iv Asks which operation does it want to perform  (+,-,/,*,++,--,%)
V Stores that result and responds with the calculated value by using an alert. </h3>

const operator = prompt('Enter operator ( either +, -, * or / ): ');

const number1 = parseFloat(prompt('Enter first number: '));
const number2 = parseFloat(prompt('Enter second number: '));

let result;


if (operator == '+') {
    result = number1 + number2;
}
else if (operator == '-') {
    result = number1 - number2;
}
else if (operator == '*') {
    result = number1 * number2;
}
else {
    result = number1 / number2;
}

console.log(`${number1} ${operator} ${number2} = ${result}`);

Output:
2 + 2 = 4

T2: using this array
var array = ["Banana", "Apples", "Oranges", "Blueberries"];
1. Remove the Banana from the array.
2. Sort the array in order.
3. Put "Kiwi" at the end of the array.
4. Remove "Apples" from the array.
5. Sort the array in reverse order. (Not alphabetical, but reverse// the current Array i.e. ['a', 'c', 'b'] becomes ['b', 'c', 'a'])

T3: Alarm ringing !
i.	Suppose by default there is a prompt saying “ Alarm is ringing”. Press ‘S’ to snooze and ‘D’ to dismiss 
ii.	If user selects ‘D’, program will be dismissed with a prompt “Good Morning”
iii.	If user select ‘S’ , the program “ Alarm is ringing”. Press ‘S’ to snooze and ‘D’ to dismiss will rerun and again the prompt will be  (repeat from step I)
iv.	upon entering wrong input program will prompt “wrong input” and program ends.
